### The Model & the Solution

Since this is supposed to work as a simple example, the model used is a simple **Real Business Cycle model**.
The value function is:

For both the CPU and the GPU algorithm we employ a "brute force" algorithm:

1. Start with a guess for the value function, `V0`;
2. Take the capital grid point `k`;
3. Iterate from `k_lower_bound` to `k_u(k)`, where `k_u` is such that implied consumption is not negative;
4. Save the results in the new value function approxiamtion `V1`;
5. Iterate until convergence;

The main concepts behind this work are from "**_Tapping the Supercomputer under your Desk: Solving Dynamic Equilibrium Models with Graphics Processors_**" by Eric M. Aldrich, Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, A. Ronald Gallant and Juan F. Rubio-Ramírez.

### Notes:

- The **[OpenCL.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/OpenCL.jl)**, **[GPUArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/GPUArrays.jl)** and **[CLArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/CLArrays.jl)** packages are required to run the GPU code.
- The `IJulia` package is necessary to run the IJupyter notebook.
- The OpenCL kernel used is available standalone in the repository.
